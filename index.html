<p>Now here's a problem that bothers me very very much!!!
I'm trying to get a list of numbers that can result in one 
another when something weird happens!!
When you take any 2 of those numbers and you multiply them, 
and you divide the result by any chosen number of your choice,
you get a number as a remainder which already belongs to that number list(or 'crop')
which you formally chose.<br/>

For instance, I'll list 2 4 5 6 and 7, now I chose 8 to be a divider.
Here we go: 2 multiplied by 6 is equal to 12. Now 12 divided by 8 is equal to 1 remaining 4(our answer!!).
Good 4 is in the original group! Seems like we on! But wait!!! 4 times 6 is 24. And that divided by 8 is 0
which isn't on the list. Ha! We don't have a crop!!!<br/><br/>

Try for your selves and find as many crops under any divider you choose. But try to follow the rules.
Send me your crops and how you think those numbers relate. In fact tell what anything on there!!! techiemechanic@gmail.com.<br/>
Thankia!!!</p></strong></div><br/><br/>
